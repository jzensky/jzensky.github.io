    <h1>Jordyn Padzensky's Assignment 2!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <p><b>Here is all the documentation for Assignment 2: Fade!</b></p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>The prompt is to create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses all of the following:
      <li> several LEDs (at least 3),</li>
      <li> a button, tilt switch, or a switch you make yourself,</li>
      <li> a for-loop,</li>
      <li> digitalWrite(),</li>
      <li> digitalRead(),</li>
      <li> and analogWrite().</li>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Here is my schematic!</h2>
    <img src="A2-Schematic.png" />
    <p> I wired each leg of the RBG LED to its own pin (PWM pins 9-11) in order to change the colors by controlling them independently with different PWM values. 
      After the resistors, each positive leg of the RGB LED is connected to the same ground to represent the structure of the RBG LED having a singular negative leg. 
      The type of resistor for each leg of the RBG LED is based on calculation using Ohm's Law. 
      For the red and green LEDs, using 5V minus a 1.8V drop for the LED, 
      and 20mA (or 0.02A) of current (based on the optimal level to power these LEDs), I calculated that each required 160 ohms of resistance.
      Since I don't have a 160 ohm resistor, I rounded up to 220 ohms. 
      I rounded up because, according to Ohm's law, this would slightly reduce the current to around 14.5mA, which only slightly reduces the brightness of the LED.
      If I rounded down, the current would increase beyond 20mA, which would risk the LED burning out. 
      I followed this calculation process for the blue LED, which has a voltage drop of 3.3V. 
      Using this value, I calculated 85 ohms of resistance, which I rounded up to 100 based on my available resistors.
      For the button, I wired it to pin 2 to track its state.
      I also wired the button to a 10k ohm resistor, then ground, based on two factors:
      <li> When the switch is not pressed, it connects pin 2 to ground. This keeps the wire from "floating".</li>
      <li> When the switch is pressed, the resistor ensures that the circuit isn't sending 5V to ground, which can hurt the Arduino and power supply.</li>
      Lastly, the button is connected to 5V to ensure pin 2 will detect HIGH when the button is pressed, enabling the functionality.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p> On my breadboard, I used color-coordinated wires to connect each PWM pin (9-11) to appropriate resistors, then each positive leg of the RBG LED.
        I used a black wire to connect the negative leg of the LED to ground.
        I then connected leg 1 of the button switch to digital pin 2, leg 2 to the resistor, then ground, and leg 4 to 5V.
        With this arrangement, when the button isn't pressed, no voltage will pass from leg 4 to legs 1 and 2, resulting in a LOW reading from pin 2.
        When the button is pressed, the voltage will pass through and be measured as HIGH by pin 2 (connected to leg 1). </p>

      <p> In my code, I use constant variables to set the pin numbers of each positive leg of the RGB LED and the button. 
        They are constants because they won't change, unlike the last variable.
        The last variable tracks the state of the button, which will change between 0 and 1 based on whether or not the button is pressed.
        In my code, I used an if-statement with a nested for-loop, with it's own nested if-statement to iterate through 6 colors on the RGB LED. 
        While the button is pressed at the end or beginning of the loop, it will turn off the LED entirely.
        It's worth noting that I could've made a function to set each color and delay to keep my code a bit more organized, but I decided to leave it as-is for this assignment.
        Also, I could get rid of the for-loop and nested if-statement entirely and have the color cycling nested in a single if-statement
         to be on if the button isn't pressed and vice-versa, but I chose this structure and functionality for the assignment criteria.</p>

      <br>
      <h2> And lastly, here are some additional questions and answers!</h2>
      <br>
      <p><b>1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. 
        Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with 
        analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).</b></p>
      <img src="A2-Graph.jpg" />
      <p> This graph of Voltage vs Time shows how an LED with a Duty Cycle of 255 will be constantly on,
          while a cycle of 128 will be on for 50% of the cycle, and a cycle of 64 will be on for 25% of the cycle.
          The length of a full cycle is 2 milliseconds, as found <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/analog-output/">here</a> on Arduino docs.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, 
        how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</b></p>
      <p>My circuit cycles through 6 colors: red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white, with each staying lit for 1 second.
        If I assume each RGB LED color draws 20mA at full brightness (255) and 10mA at half brightness (128) then the current draw for each color is as follows:
        <li>Red: 20mA</li>
        <li>Yellow: 40mA (20mA red + 20mA green)</li>
        <li>Green: 20mA</li>
        <li>Blue: 20mA</li>
        <li>Purple: 20mA (10mA red + 10mA blue)</li>
        <li>White: 60mA (20mA red + 20mA green + 20mA blue)</li>
        This means the total current draw for one full cycle of colors (6 seconds) is 180mA. 
        Dividing 180mA by 6 seconds gives an average current draw of 30mA.
        Dividing the battery capacity of 1200mAh by the average current draw of 30mA gives a total run time of 40 hours.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>3: Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on. 
        How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?</b></p>
      <p> Using a multimeter, I measured the forward voltage across each color of my RGB LED when it was on each color in the cycle:
        <li>Red: R=2.04V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is slightly higher than expected.</li>
        <li>Yellow: R=2.03V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is slightly higher than expected. G=2.58V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is decently higher than expected.</li>
        <li>Green: G=2.59V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is decently higher than expected.</li>
        <li>Blue: B=2.92V (theoretical: 3.3V), this is decently lower than expected.</li>
        <li>Purple: R=1.01V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is decently lower than expected. B=1.46V (theoretical: 3.3V), this is decently lower than expected.</li>
        <li>White: R=2.00V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is slightly higher than expected. G=2.56V (theoretical: 1.8V), this is decently higher than expected. B=2.89V (theoretical: 3.3V), this is decently lower than expected.</li>
        Overall, the green pin tended to be decently higher than expected, the blue pin tended to be decently lower than expected, and the red pin varied the most.
        Since theoretical forward voltages are typical ranges in testing conditions at a fixed current (20 mA), while the actual LED current varies with shared connections and resistor values, these differences are to be expected.
